Name: Alligator and Crocodile (25)

Description: 6'-12' long (and up!), 200-800lbs (and way up!) of scaly, toothy apex predator. A long, largely flat body with stubby legs projecting to the sides, fronted by an elongated jaw, backed by a powerful tail, and covered in green, black, and sometimes banded yellow scales. Stats are for a larger alligator or common crocodile, 12' long and 800 lbs. A 6' specimen might be ST 13 and SM 0. A 20' monster would be ST 25, 2,000lbs and SM +2 (much of its length is tail).Mutation Notes: Additional DR (Semi-Ablative -20%) [4/point] with total DR (normal and semi-ablative) up to 1/3 HPs can be bought to represent an truly thick carapace. Mutants can also purchase Subsonic Speech [10]. GMs may also permit the Dash (Buy as +4 Move (costs 1 FP -10%) [18] and Enhanced Move 1.5x [10]), though real Alligators and Crocodiles simply make a surprise lunge, and top out at 14-17mph on the run (which is a Move 6 sprint).

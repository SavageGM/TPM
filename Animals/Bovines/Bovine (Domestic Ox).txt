Name: Bovine (Domestic Ox) (-55)

Description: Huge grazing animals with long curved horns and largely hairless skin. Below describes a savannah African Buffalo. Bison are similar but somewhat smaller, ST 23 (NFM -40%, Size -10%) [65], SM +1, Move 7/14 [10]. Domestic Cattle are usually smaller, ST 21 (NFM -40%; Size -10%) [55], SM +1, Move 5/10 [0], and Domestic Animal [-30], change DR to DR 2 (Skull only -70%) [3] and drop the overall DR. The largest breeds are as big as the Buffalo described here, though still slower. Oxen are domestic cattle trained to do work, and if they are steers (not all are) can be very large, ST 27, DX 8, Move 4/8 [-5]. All of these have breeds with horns, some quite long.Mutation Notes: Even natural Buffalo, cattle and oxen (though not bison) sometimes have horns that qualify for Long +100%. Either gender can have horns. The tough skin DR represents a shaggy coat or thick hide, which will look quite distinctive on a human shaped mutant.

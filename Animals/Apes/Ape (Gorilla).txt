Notes:
Description: Representing the great apes (Chimpanzees, Gorillas, and Orangutans). Chimps and Gorillas are black furred, Orangutans are red furred. All have usable hands and prehensile feet, and range from short human (Orangutans), to human sized (Chimps), to big human (Gorillas). The below listing is for a Chimp. Gorillas are larger and stronger, ST 15 (Size -10%) [45] and SM +1, add Herbivore [-1]. Orangutans are somewhat smaller, ST 9 [-10]. 
Mutation Notes: Apes can be considered to have Unnatural Features for the purposes of using Disguise to look like a human (essentially, Partial Looks). This isn't worth any points, and should be considered Unnatural Features 4 (Fur, muzzle, long arms, short legs). Mutant Apes can purchase Sensitive Touch [10].
